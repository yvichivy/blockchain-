# Blockchain 

The goal  is to implement a blockchain data structure using a graph data structure in order to store and validate a series of transactions and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

A blockchain is a distributed database that records transactions in a way that makes them resistant to tampering and revision. It consists of a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block. This creates a secure and decentralized ledger of transactions that can be used in various applications, such as cryptocurrency systems, supply chain management, health care, and voting systems.

A graph data structure is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges connecting the vertices. It is a flexible and powerful data structure that can be used to represent various types of relationships between data. In the context of a blockchain, a graph data structure can be used to represent the blockchain as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of blocks, with the vertices representing the blocks and the edges representing the relationships between the blocks.

Using a graph data structure to implement a blockchain has several advantages. It allows for the representation of complex relationships between blocks, such as forks and branches in the chain. It also enables efficient operations on the blockchain, such as adding and removing blocks, and checking the validity of the chain.

In the future, graph data structures are likely to play a key role in the development and evolution of blockchain technology. They will enable the creation of more advanced and sophisticated blockchain systems that can handle a wider range of transactions and NFTs, and that can be adapted to meet the changing needs of various applications.
